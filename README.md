# FloodSAT
### **FloodSAT** is an AI-powered flood detection and analysis system developed by ConCodes during the NASA Space Challenge hackathon.

## project summary
#### FloodSAT leverages satellite imagery to identify flooded areas in near real-time. It utilizes a deep learning semantic segmentation model fine-tuned on limited labeled Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data. FloodSAT provides an automated flood mapping and monitoring system to empower emergency managers with near real-time flood intelligence for improved situational awareness and response. It also enables new insights into flood patterns to inform community planning and infrastructure design.

## Potential applications
#### FloodSAT has a wide range of potential applications, including:

* Emergency response: FloodSAT can provide near real-time flood intelligence to emergency managers, enabling them to make faster and more informed decisions.
* Flood monitoring: FloodSAT can be used to monitor flood extent and patterns over time. This information can be used to identify areas at risk of flooding and to develop flood mitigation strategies.
* Infrastructure planning and design: FloodSAT can be used to inform community planning and infrastructure design by identifying areas that are frequently flooded and by modeling the potential impact of future floods.

## Future work
The ConCodes team is planning to continue developing the system in several ways:

* Improve the accuracy of the flood detection model: The team is working to improve the accuracy of the flood detection model by training it on a larger dataset of labeled HLS imagery.
* Add support for additional satellite data sources: The team is planning to add support for additional satellite data sources, such as Radar and SAR data, to improve the performance of FloodSAT in challenging environmental conditions.
* Develop new analytics capabilities: The team is planning to develop new analytics capabilities, such as flood damage assessment and flood prediction, to enhance the utility of FloodSAT for emergency managers and other users.
